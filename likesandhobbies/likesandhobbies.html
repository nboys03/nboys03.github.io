        <h1>Likes and Hobbies</h1>
    </header>
    <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a variety of hobbies that I enjoy. I love crocheting and the fact
        that I can craft unique gifts for my family. I’m also an avid reader, and I love exploring new worlds and
        gaining a deeper understanding about ours. Music is another one of my passions. Whether it’s listening to my
        favorite songs, finding new artists, or unwinding on the piano, music is always a part of my day. Finally, I
        also enjoy gaming as a way to challenge myself and connect with family.
