    <p>NITARP (NASA/IPAC Teacher Archive Research Program) is a NASA research program that partners small groups of high
        school educators and their students with a mentor professional astronomer for an original research project. At
        the end, each team writes up the results of their research and presents it in a science poster session at an
        American Astronomical Society meeting.
    </p>
    <p>My dad, a high school earth and space science teacher, was one of the teachers selected for this project. The
        research
        project that we worked on was OIRMA (Optical/Infrared Mapping of AGN). AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei) are
        supermassive black holes that are found at the center of some galaxies. They are surrounded by a rotating
        accretion disc, which is then surrounded by a thick, dusty, donut-shaped torus. The goal of the project was to
        use continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) to measure the size of their accretion disks. Over the course of the
        project, I created and analyzed over 250 light curves to help accomplish this goal. The project team also ended
        up making four posters, as shown below. </p>
