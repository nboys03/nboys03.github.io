    <p>IDATA (Innovators Developing Accessible Tools for Astronomy) was a multimillion-dollar NSF research project. Its
        goal was to create Afterglow Access, a blind-and-visually-impaired (BVI) friendly astronomical image/data
        analysis software. Two key aspects made Afterglow Access BVI-friendly. First, the entire software is
        screen-reader-friendly, which allows for easier navigation around the website. Second, the software uses
        sonification to transform deep space images into sound. To understand how sonification works, imagine a piano is
        laid over the bottom of an image that slowly moves up the image. If a bright spot appears in the image (like a
        star), the key corresponding to its horizontal position is played. The brighter the star, the louder the volume.

    <p>My work in the IDATA project involved attending biweekly meetings at a local high school. During these meetings,
        we worked on activities that helped guide the design of the software and that helped make astronomy a more
        inclusive science. I also led coding activities during these meetings. In January 2020, I had the honor to
        co-present the IDATA poster (“Research Supporting Multisensory Engagement by Blind, Visually Impaired, and
        Sighted Students to Advance Integrated Learning of Astronomy and Computer Science”) at the American
        Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu, HI. I also was one of the co-leads of the Afterglow Access Manual
        Development Team. The goal of this team was to create a manual for the software created by the IDATA project. My
        tasks included arranging and leading meetings with the writing team and main programmer of the software,
        editing/formatting the entire manual before publication, and revising the manual after software updates.</p>
