    <p>Throughout my time at UW-Madison, I’ve had the opportunity to take a variety of courses that have not only
        expanded my knowledge of but have also fueled my passion for mechanical engineering. Below is a list of a few of
        my favorite courses that have challenged me, fostered my curiosity for engineering, and contributed to my growth
        as an engineering student!
    </p>

    <h2>ME 201: Introduction to Mechanical Engineering</h2>
    <p>This was one of the first classes that I’ve taken at UW-Madison, and it did a fantastic job of introducing the
        engineering design process. It had a semester-long project which main involved the design of an autonomous
        trolley. There were many challenges that the trolley was put through including a hill climb, a race, and
        following a leading trolley that randomly sped up and down. Some fun features of the trolley were a spoiler,
        custom hubcaps, brake lights, and an airbrake. Below are some pictures of the trolley with the 3D printed parts
        that I designed for it, as well as a video about the trolley. </p>

    <h2>ME 306/307: Mechanics of Materials</h2>
    <p>I greatly enjoyed Mechanics of Materials because it allowed me to understand more of the theory behind materials,
        stresses, and failure. It did a fantastic job applying these concepts to real-world problems. This class also
        included a lab section that further cemented these ideas and let me control real-life failure experiments.</p>

    <h2>ME 361: Thermodynamics</h2>
    <p>Despite being concerned about this course's difficulty before I took it, it turned out to be one of my
        my favorite classes. Professor Nellis did a fantastic job clearly explaining the topics, and I enjoyed learning
        more about how the heat and energy systems work in real life.</p>

    <h2>ME 310: Polymers</h2>
    <p>For better or worse, polymers and plastics are everywhere. I enjoyed Polymers Processing and Manufacturing
        because it provided an interesting look into how so many products are made. It combined theory with hands-on
        learning, which gave me the ability to understand the theory and function of many processing techniques like
        injection molding, extrusion, thermoforming, and additive manufacturing. Below is one of the models that I made
        in this course: an aerial view of the UW-Madison college of engineering campus.</p>

    <h2>EMA 202: Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Kinematics is by far my favorite branch of physics, and dynamics gave me a deeper understanding of this topic.
        Professor Sonny did a fantastic job teaching this topic in a clear way. Prior to this class, I had only ever
        solved kinematics problems using algebra, so it was fun to learn how to use calculus to solve real-world physics
        problems.</p>

    <h2>Comp Sci 200, 300, and 400: Java I-III</h2>
    <p>While I love mechanical engineering, I also love coding. Comp Sci 200 gave a great introduction to Java and its
        syntax. Comp Sci 300 went more in-depth and introduced me to sorting algorithms and algorithm efficiency. Comp
        Sci 400 introduced me to data structures, webpage/app development, and how to design programs efficiently.</p>
